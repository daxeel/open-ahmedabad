# Open Ahmedabad Organisation

The idea behind the initiative is to maintain public data and make it available to different communities to build some amazing tools out of it.

The projects under this initiative are tracked [here](https://github.com/DatameetAMD/open-ahmedabad-web/issues/). Kindly follow the thread for any updates.

## Contributing

It is an open source communitiy. Anyone can contribute here. To be an official collaborator drop an email to [ndkcha](mailto:ndkcha@gmail.com?subject=Regarding contribution in Open Ahmedabad) or [jimishio](mailto:jimishparekh123@gmail.com?subject=Regarding contribution in Open Ahmedabad). You can always fork the repository to resolve issues or make new contribution and submit pull request to merge it.

We considered starting the projects using simple HTML5 webpages and a light usage of bootstrap framework. Do consult us before you start contributing for appropriate assignments of tasks and better understanding of the architecture.

If come across any issue or suggestions or (if you're non-tech person) suggestions or any support for development team, drop us an email or open an issue on github. *(Adding unnecessary issues will slow down the development process, please look up the existing issues before you submit a new one)*
